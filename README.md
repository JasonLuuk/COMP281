 ## Must See Before Read My code
All the problems the title come from this site https://student.csc.liv.ac.uk/JudgeOnline/problemset.php 

My aim is to get first in every problem's status on this website,to achieve this, I try to keep the size of my code as small as possible, which means I use a lot of single-character variable names and meaningless function names (Never use meaningless variable names and meaningless function names, unless it's just a robot check your code), which will take you extra time to understand my code, and that's how you learn!
